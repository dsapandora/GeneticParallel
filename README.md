Genetics Algorithm Parallelization
================

A generic optimization software that uses genetic algorithms, implemented in C++

Read the  "Runner.cpp" and for an explanation of what the parameters received by the genetic algorithm
are look at the "GeneticAlgorithmRun" function.

Despite the name, this library doesn't implement a parallelized genetic algorithm, since this is the first version I created and is missing a lot of optimizations.
